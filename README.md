# Airlines-Finance
Goal is to present financial statements and basic financial analysis of United Airlines, Delta Airlines, and American Airlines.
Currently created financial statements for UAL and DAL from 2017-2019, still need to add Cont. Airlines. Immediate impressions 
are that both have negative working capital ratios, something that may be unique to the industry. DAL has had increasing payables 
turnover, possibly due to improved negotions with suppliers (will need to confirm), however UAL is consistently higher here.
UAL has a notably higher debt-to-assets ratio but similar debt-to-equity ratios, suggesting higher debt financing at UAL. This
combined with the higher payables turnover and receivables turnover may suggest difficulties with collecting and paying. UAL
also has consistently lower pretax operating, and net profit margins. Both companies have fairly consistent asset leverage around
4.5 however UAL has lower ROA across all three years, leading to a lower ROE. Both companies have seen decreasing P/B and P/E despite 
increasing average price. Just based on these ratios, DAL appears to be a more consistent, less risky investment.
